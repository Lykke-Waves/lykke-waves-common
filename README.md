# The results of the contest

Fuck you, Lykke, this company is fraud and deception. I have never met so many incompetent IT experts, I hope you will go bankrupt and people will not trust money to the swindlers. If I knew that before the integration of my decision, I will not get any money and that you have no mutual interest in doing it - I would not take part in this and would not advise anyone.  It was a waste of my time. Burn in hell.
