# lykke-waves-common
Lykke Waves common library. It contains common classes for accessing data and interfaces and required to build the project modules.

# Installation

The build library uses [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/):

```
sbt clean publishLocal
```

After that, the library will be available in the local ivy2 repository `~/.ivy2` for other sbt projects.
